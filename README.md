# 🎬 Youtube Clone – Java OOP Project

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a simplified **Youtube Clone** developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles.

It was created as an academic project to simulate the core functionalities of a video-sharing platform and to strengthen understanding of software design, class relationships, and modular programming.

The system models how users interact with videos, channels, comments, and platform features.
